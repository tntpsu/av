# Critical Lessons for AV Stack Development

## Steering Direction Lesson (2025-12-25)

**What Happened:**
- Added negation fix → Removed it (theoretical reasoning) → Added back (data proved it)
- Wasted time due to sign convention confusion

**The Lesson:**
- Test empirically, not theoretically
- Write tests FIRST for control logic
- Don't remove fixes based on theory alone
- Verify with data, not just reasoning

**Prevention:**
- test_lateral_controller_steering_direction() catches this
- Validation logging in av_stack.py warns if wrong
- See DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md for full details

**Remember:** "Test empirically, not theoretically. Data beats reasoning."
